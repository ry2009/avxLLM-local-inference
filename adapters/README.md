# Adapters Folder
Drop LoRA/DoRA/Q-LoRA adapters here for local experiments. Each adapter should live under `adapters/<name>` and contain the usual Hugging Face metadata (`adapter_config.json`, `adapter_model.safetensors`, tokenizer files, etc.). The folder is empty by default to keep the repo lightweight.
